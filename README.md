# CoffeeVendorMachineSystem
The actual work of coffee vendor machine is provide the coffee to user and give the balance change to user.
I replicate the coffee vendor machine system in a python program.

It will first ask you , did you like to have some coffee. And when the user gives 'Yes' to the system.
Then user have to select the coffee and as per the insturuction in the program..

When user buys a coffee and each time cost of coffee will reduce in your packet money


For access this system, you have to download zip file and extract it!.

Either, you have to download in terminal using git clone

       git clone https://github.com/MohansGopi/CoffeeVendorMchineSystem
       
       cd CoffeeVendorMachineSystem
       
       python coffee_vendor
       
       
       
By using this method you can use this system.
